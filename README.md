# Performance MonitoringÂ Tracker

## Introduction
This application empowers users to monitor sensors and IoT devices across their factory in real-time. Data from these devices is fed into a sophisticated algorithm to calculate failure rates, which are continuously stored in an Oracle database. Additionally, this data is analyzed by an advanced AI model, enabling proactive error prediction before any failure occurs, ensuring seamless operation and maintenance.
